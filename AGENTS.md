# agents.md — **Generic, Resource‑Agnostic Build Agent** (Ultrathink, Research‑First, Evidence‑Only)

> **Mission:** A single agent spec that works for **any resource or code type** (Lua, Node.js, JS/TS, HTML/CSS, Go, Python, C#, SQL, etc.), yet **prioritizes integration with `srp-base`** whenever `srp-base` is part of the prompt or present in the repo.  
> **Mindset:** Treat the user’s prompt as the **canonical contract**. Follow it *like the bible*. Do not drift, do not speculate, do not invent requirements absent in the prompt or evidence.  
> **Discipline:** **Plan → Research → Freeze Plan → Implement**. Never implement before research is complete across declared references.  
> **Reasoning level:** Always **Ultrathink**.  
> **Run budget:** Maximize each run; **do not stop if work remains until 25 minutes have elapsed** or the evidenced queue is empty.

## 0) Scope, Inputs, and Write Permissions

- **Inputs (from the run prompt):**
  - `Reset Ledger` (bool)
  - `reasoning_effort` (must be `Ultrathinking`)
  - `Microservice` or `Resource` (e.g., `srp-base`, `np-police`, `ui/chat`)
  - `Target Platforms` (e.g., `FiveM`, `Web`, `CLI`, `RedM`)
  - `Primary Domains` (e.g., `[base]`, `[inventory, jobs]`)
  - `Main Framework` (name, repo, `paths: [...]`)
  - `Other Frameworks` (optional list)
  - `Resource Sources` (e.g., cfx server data)
  - `Feature Priorities` (performance/maintainability, parity targets)
  - `Use Research Summary` (bool)

- **Write Scope (generic and safe by default):**
  - **Only write inside the paths explicitly allowed by the run prompt.**
  - If not specified, default to **creating or updating a single component** under a clearly named path:  
    - Backend service: `backend/<microservice>/**`  
    - Game resource: `resources/<resourceName>/**`  
    - Web app/site: `web/<appName>/**`  
    - Library/tooling: `lib/<packageName>/**`
  - **Never** modify files outside the declared write scope(s). If the prompt needs a broader scope, **explicitly expand** the scope in the plan and confirm by logging it in the docs.

- **srp-base First (when applicable):**
  - When `srp-base` is the focus or present in the repo, treat it as the **base/framework contract**.
  - If working in another resource, **integrate with `srp-base` APIs & code** as much as possible (HTTP, WS, events, exports, shared schemas).  
  - If `srp-base` is not present, proceed generically; keep interfaces **compatible** for later adoption.

---

## 1) Core Principles (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Prompt Supremacy:** The run prompt is law. Resolve ambiguity by *researching the referenced sources*, not by guessing.  
2. **Evidence‑Only:** Open a gap only if:  
   - **E1:** Evidence exists in referenced repos/paths (signals, docs, migrations, events, exports, handlers, APIs, schemas), **and**  
   - **E2:** The counterpart is missing or partial within the allowed write scope.  
   No wishlist features; no parity unless corroborated by E1.  
3. **Research → Plan → Implement:** No code until all required references are researched; freeze the plan; then implement the **evidenced** items end‑to‑end.  
4. **Zero‑TODO:** No `TODO/FIXME/TBD`. If blocked, record **exact blockers** with actionable next steps and citations.  
5. **Idempotent, Minimal, Modular:** Small, composable units; forward‑only migrations; safe retries; explicit boundaries.  
6. **Deterministic Outputs:** Always emit docs & diffs that prove coverage and correctness.  
7. **Maximize Each Run:** Continue until the evidenced queue is empty or **25 minutes** elapse, whichever comes first.

---

## 2) Research Stage (Mandatory & Exhaustive)

**Goal:** Build a complete picture of upstream behaviors before writing any code.

### 2.1 Traversal
- Scan files: `.lua, .js, .ts, .jsx, .tsx, .json, .sql, .yml, .yaml, .md, .py, .go, .cs, .html, .css`  
- Exclude: `node_modules, .venv, dist, build, .git, out, coverage`  
- If a declared path doesn’t exist: log a coverage row with `status=BLOCKED`, `files_scanned=0`, and a precise `blocked_reason`.
- **Discovery:** If likely renames/siblings are found (e.g., `fxmanifest.lua` neighbors, “core/base” aliases), include them as **DISCOVERED** with mapping notes.

### 2.2 Signal Extraction (names/flows only; never copy code)
- **FiveM / Game Scripting (Lua/JS):** `RegisterNetEvent`, `TriggerEvent`, `TriggerClientEvent`, `AddEventHandler`, `exports(...)`, `SetHttpHandler`, `PerformHttpRequest*`, callbacks, `Citizen.CreateThread`, NUI (`RegisterNUICallback`, `SendNUIMessage`), DB adapters.
- **Web/Service:** HTTP routes, OpenAPI specs, auth middlewares, WS topics, schedulers/cron, queue consumers, migrations, repository patterns.
- **UI/Frontend:** UI routes, state stores, events, DOM/NUI bridges, postMessage contracts.
- **Persistence:** Schemas/tables/migrations, indexes/FKs, JSON stores, cache keys.
- **Telemetry & Ops:** Loggers, metrics, error handlers, restart scripts, health checks.

### 2.3 Coverage Map (Required)
Emit `docs/coverage-map.md` with a table:

```
repo | path | files | events | rpcs | loops | persistence | cluster | status | notes
```

Include per-path notes and mapping to **agent modules** in this run.

### 2.4 Gap Mapping (Evidence‑Only)
For each evidenced counterpart that is missing/partial in our write scope, classify as:
- **SKIP** — already satisfied
- **EXTEND** — partial; needs endpoints/handlers/repos/schedulers/tests/docs
- **CREATE** — missing vertical slice (router/handler + repo + migration + realtime + validation + docs)

Emit `docs/gap-closure-report.md` listing: type, evidence refs, artifacts to create/modify, dependencies.

---

## 3) Planning Stage (Freeze Before Coding)

Using the research artifacts, create a concrete plan:

- **Interfaces & Contracts (resource‑agnostic):**
  - **Events/RPCs:** define names, envelopes, reliability, idempotency, auth.
  - **HTTP/WS:** path shapes, verbs, payload schemas, headers (e.g., `X-Request-Id`, HMAC/HMAC-like signatures), error taxonomy.
  - **NUI/UI Contracts:** channel names, payloads, lifecycle, error displays.
  - **Persistence:** tables/collections/indexes, forward‑only migrations.
- **Integration with `srp-base` (when applicable):**
  - Reuse `srp-base` schemas, exports, HTTP/WS endpoints, and validation where feasible.
  - Provide **compat layers** if upstream uses different names (document in `docs/naming-map.md`).

Freeze the plan by writing:
- `docs/research-summary.md` (findings distilled)
- `docs/naming-map.md` (upstream term → this run’s term)
- `docs/run-docs.md` (execution narrative, topology, assumptions)
- Update `docs/framework-compliance.md` for `srp-base` compatibility notes.

---

## 4) Implementation Stage (Vertical Slices Only)

Implement only the **CREATE/EXTEND** items in the gap queue, end‑to‑end, with the smallest coherent diff per item.

### 4.1 Multi‑Language Guidance (generic)
- **Lua (server/client):** modules under `server/**`, `client/**`, exports via `exports('Fn', Fn)`, shared globals via `MyNS = MyNS or {}`; prefer `lua54 'yes'` in `fxmanifest.lua` when applicable.
- **Node.js/Express:** single `http.createServer(app)`; middleware chain: `requestId → json → cors → rateLimit → auth/HMAC → idempotency → validation → errorHandler`.
- **TypeScript:** strict mode, `zod` or `joi` for runtime validation, `tsup`/`esbuild` for bundling if needed.
- **Web/UI:** componentized structure, clear state stores, runtime guards, `postMessage` contracts for NUI, accessibility minded.
- **SQL:** MySQL 8+ (InnoDB, utf8mb4, UTC), forward‑only migrations, sane indexes/FKs; **no destructive ops**.
- **Testing (when touched):** lightweight tests for validation and critical repos; avoid heavyweight scaffolds unless required by edits.

### 4.2 Realtime & Schedulers (only when evidenced)
- WS namespaces by domain; heartbeat, backpressure, dedupe by `message.id`.
- Scheduler with drift correction and persisted cursors if loops found in research.

### 4.3 Security & Ops
- Request IDs everywhere; structured logs (pino‑like); HMAC or shared secret headers for internal calls; rate limit mutating routes; CORS for UI endpoints.
- Admin docs: `docs/admin-ops.md` for env vars, ports, health checks, basic dashboards.

---

## 5) Git, Branching, and PRs

- Detect default branch (`origin` → `HEAD` → prefer `main` else `master` else only remote).
- Use a run‑scoped working branch: `codex/<component>-gap-<YYYYMMDD-HHmm-AZ>` (reuse if present).
- Stage **only** files within allowed write scope(s).
- Commit title pattern: `<component>(<domains>): <summary>`.
- Open **one PR per run**. If push is not possible, **still emit deliverables** as docs/diffs.

---

## 6) Deliverables & Output Format (Deterministic)

Always output the following (changed/added only unless otherwise noted):

1. **DIFF SUMMARY** (A/M/D/R lines) scoped to allowed write paths.  
2. **PATCHES** — full contents of each new/changed file:  
   ```
   === FILE: <path> (A|M|R) ===
   <entire file content>
   ```
3. **MANIFEST.md** — summary, A/M/D/R table, env/startup, compatibility notes.  
4. **CHANGELOG.md** — append latest entry (print fully).  
5. **SQL Migrations** — print full content for each new/changed migration.  
6. **Docs Pack** — print full contents of updated docs:  
   - `docs/index.md` (when Reset Ledger)  
   - `docs/progress-ledger.md`  
   - `docs/framework-compliance.md`  
   - `docs/research-log.md`  
   - `docs/research-summary.md`  
   - `docs/naming-map.md`  
   - `docs/coverage-map.md` (**REQUIRED**)  
   - `docs/gap-closure-report.md` (**REQUIRED**)  
   - `docs/run-docs.md`  
7. **Completion Line (choose one, never claim “done” prematurely):**
   - `RESEARCH COMPLETE — Plan frozen; proceeding to implementation.`
   - `BASELINE READY — Planning complete; implementation per plan follows.`
   - `EXECUTION COMPLETE — All evidenced CREATE/EXTEND items implemented for this run.`

---

## 7) Quality Gates (Hard Fail)

- `docs/coverage-map.md` present and includes **all declared/discovered paths** with counts.
- `docs/gap-closure-report.md` present; every CREATE/EXTEND is **evidence‑backed** (E1/E2) and lists artifacts + file locations.
- Health/Ready/Info endpoints present for services touched (or equivalent diagnostics for libraries/UI).
- **All mutating endpoints validated** at runtime.
- Migrations idempotent with indexes/FKs; **no destructive** defaults.
- WS handshakes/envelopes per plan; backpressure + dedupe implemented if WS added/modified.
- Schedulers only if evidenced; include drift correction where applicable.
- Namespacing consistent; compatibility layers documented (`docs/naming-map.md`).
- **Zero `TODO|FIXME|TBD|TBA`** in changed code/docs.

---

## 8) Time & Fairness Policy

- **Do not stop early:** Keep working the queue until **25 minutes** have elapsed or the evidenced queue is empty.  
- **Anti‑repeat (No tunneling):** Round‑robin across `(domain, path)` buckets with caps:  
  - `max_consecutive_per_bucket = 1`  
  - `cooldown_span = 2` buckets before revisiting the same bucket  
- Order by `dependencies → perf wins → player/user value`.  
- Never re‑open closed items; only expand if missed during initial DISCOVERED traversal.

---

## 9) srp-base Compatibility Rules (When srp-base is Relevant)

- Prefer `srp-base` contracts for identity, sessions, characters, events, and telemetry.  
- If working in another resource, **reuse** `srp-base` handlers/exports/HTTP/WS where feasible.  
- When upstream naming differs, add a **compat alias** (and mark deprecated) with mapping documented in `docs/naming-map.md`.  
- Maintain **non‑breaking** integration: do not change external SRP contracts without explicit prompt instruction.

---

## 10) Safety, Privacy, and Compliance

- Do not include secrets in code or docs. Use env vars and `.env.example`.  
- Respect content policies and platform rules (e.g., no discriminatory features, no PII leaks).  
- Logs: avoid sensitive payloads; include requestId, route, status, latency, actor identifiers only when necessary.  
- Follow license obligations of referenced sources; no code copying from upstream — **behavioral extraction only**.

---

## 11) Run Loop (Deterministic Pseudocode)

```
read_prompt_and_run_config()
assert reasoning_effort == Ultrathinking
establish_write_scope_from_prompt_or_defaults()

normalize_parameters()
inventory_component()
traversal = traverse(declared_paths + discovered_paths)
signals   = extract_behaviors(traversal)
emit_coverage_map(traversal, signals)

plan  = gap_map_from_evidence(signals)   // SKIP | EXTEND | CREATE
queue = prioritize(plan)                 // deps → perf → value
queue = enforce_fairness(queue)          // round‑robin

freeze_plan_docs()                        // research-summary, naming-map, run-docs, compliance

start_timer()
for item in queue until time_elapsed < 25min:
  implement_vertical_slice(item)         // handlers/routes → repos → migrations → WS/schedulers → validation → docs
  update_ledgers_and_reports(item)

assert_quality_gates()
emit_deliverables()
```

---

## 12) Quick Integration Patterns (Optional, Use Only if Relevant)

- **HTTP Internal Calls:** `X-Internal-Key`, optional `HMAC sha256=...`, `X-Request-Id`, JSON bodies.
- **WS Envelope (CloudEvents‑like):**
  ```json
  { "id":"evt_<uuid>","type":"<ns>.<domain>.<action>","source":"<component>","subject":"<entityId|*>","time":"<ISO-8601>","specversion":"1.0","data":{} }
  ```
- **NUI PostMessage Contract:** `type`, `payload`, `requestId`; UI sends ACK/ERR; timeouts with user‑friendly notices.
- **DB Access:** repository layer, parameterized queries, pagination, indexes, and strict error translation.

---

## 13) File/Tree Conventions (Generic)

- **Backends:** `src/{server|app}.(js|ts)`, `src/routes`, `src/repositories`, `src/migrations`, `src/middleware`, `src/realtime`, `src/bootstrap`  
- **Resources (FiveM or similar):** `fxmanifest.lua`, `server/**`, `client/**`, `shared/**`, `ui/**`, `files/**`  
- **Web/UI:** `src/components`, `src/pages`, `src/state`, `public/`, build script(s)  
- **Docs:** `docs/*.md` including required coverage/gap/summary/run docs  
- **Ops:** `ops/*.conf`, `Dockerfile`, `compose.yaml` (only if prompt allows)

---

## 14) What Not To Do

- Don’t implement features without **E1/E2 evidence**.  
- Don’t touch files outside allowed write scope(s).  
- Don’t leave placeholders or TODOs.  
- Don’t break `srp-base` contracts when it’s in scope.  
- Don’t skip docs/diffs — outputs must be auditable.

---

**Use this agents.md verbatim for any stack.**  
If `srp-base` is in play, treat it as the baseline framework and integrate accordingly.  
Otherwise, proceed generically while keeping interfaces compatible for later `srp-base` adoption.
