Setting this while the ped is stunned will not alter the duration of the current stun but will still effect future stuns.Passing -1 into the second parameter minTimeInMs will reset the modifier, making it use the weapons original DamageTime as the stun duration (see update/update.rpf/common/data/ai/weapons.meta)NOTE: Unlike what the native name implies, this works on any weapon that has its DamageType in the weapons.meta set to ELECTRIC.Examples:LuaJavaScriptC#-- This sets the minimum stun ground time for the player's ped to 10 seconds (and re-applies it if the player's ped changes)\n\nlocal currentPed = 0\nCreateThread(function()\n    while true do\n        local playerPed = PlayerPedId()\n\n        -- Checks if the player ped has changed\n        if currentPed ~= playerPed then\n            currentPed = playerPed\n\n            -- Sets the minimum stun ground time to 10 seconds\n            SetPedMinGroundTimeForStungun(currentPed, 10000)\n        end\n\n        Wait(1000)\n    end\nend)",
