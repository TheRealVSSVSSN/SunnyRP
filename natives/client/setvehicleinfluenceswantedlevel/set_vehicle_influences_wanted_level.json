Set to true to make the vehicle influence the wanted level; false to prevent it from doing so.This native sets whether a specific vehicle influences the player's wanted level when it is involved in an incident that typically triggers a wanted response, such as being marked as a \"victim\" vehicle.This is particularly useful when utilizing the wanted system from GTA, and you want to prevent a vehicle from affecting the wanted level when it is stolen. In the decompiled scripts this native is only used to disable the influence of the vehicle on the wanted level.Examples:LuaJavaScriptC#-- This example will prevent the closest vehicle from influencing the wanted level.\n\n-- Retrieve the LocalPlayer\nlocal playerPed = PlayerPedId()\n\n-- Retrieve the coordinates of the player.\nlocal playerCoords = GetEntityCoords(playerPed)\n\n-- Retrieve the closest vehicle.\nlocal vehicle = GetClosestVehicle(playerCoords.x, playerCoords.y, playerCoords.z, 3, 0, 70)\n\n-- Check if the vehicle exists in the game world.\nif not DoesEntityExist(vehicle) then \n    -- If the vehicle does not exist, end the execution of the code here.\n    return \nend\n\n-- Set the vehicle to not influence the wanted level.\nSetVehicleInfluencesWantedLevel(vehicle, false)",
