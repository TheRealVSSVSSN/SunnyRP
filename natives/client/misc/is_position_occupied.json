Set to 0 if you don't want to exclude any entities.p10: Unknown.Returns: Returns true if there is anything in that location matching the provided parameters.The BOOL parameters that are documented have not been confirmed. They are just documented from what I've found during testing. They may not work as expected in all cases.",
