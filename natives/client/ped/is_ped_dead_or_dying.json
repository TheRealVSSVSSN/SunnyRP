When checkMeleeDeathFlags is set to true, it also considers peds in melee takedown moves as dying, although the broader 'dying' phase may not be detected.Determines if a ped is dead. Contrary to what the name might suggest, it does not always detect when a ped is in the 'dying' phase (transitioning to death). The exception is when checkMeleeDeathFlags is set to true, which then includes peds in the midst of melee takedown moves as being in a dying state, even if the death task has not yet started.NativeDB Introduced: v323",
