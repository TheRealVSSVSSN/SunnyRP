Applies only to peds.keepIK: If true, the Inverse Kinematics (IK) on the ped are not reset upon teleportation. Applies only to peds.doWarp: If false, the entity will maintain continuous motion and will not clear contacts nor create space for itself upon teleportation.Teleports an entity to specified coordinates directly, with options to maintain certain behaviors post-teleportation.Note:This native allows precise placement of entities without the usual adjustments for collision or interaction with the environment that may occur with other teleportation natives.The keepTasks and keepIK parameters are specifically useful for maintaining the current state of a ped, ensuring actions or animations are not abruptly stopped due to the teleportation.Setting doWarp to false is useful when simulating continuous movement or when the entity should interact with its immediate surroundings upon arrival.",
