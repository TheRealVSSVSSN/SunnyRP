It'll just stop transforming when it reaches the state you provided.Once this native is used then players will just be able to hit the vehicle transform key to toggle the transformation cycle; it won't block users from using the key.Old name:  _SET_VEHICLE_TRANSFORM_STATEOld name:  _SET_VEHICLE_HOVER_TRANSFORM_PERCENTAGEExamples:LuaJavaScriptC#-- In this case we are enabling the hover mode for the deluxo (fyling mode)\nlocal vehicle = GetVehiclePedIsIn(PlayerPedId(), false)\nSetSpecialFlightModeTargetRatio(vehicle, 1.0)",
