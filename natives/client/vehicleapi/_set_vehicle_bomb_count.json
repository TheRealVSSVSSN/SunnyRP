As far as I know, this does not impact vehicle weapons or the ammo of those weapons in any way, it is just a way to keep track of the amount of bombs in a specific plane.In decompiled scripts this is used to deduct from or add to the count whenever bombs are dropped or purchased/restocked.Use _GET_AIRCRAFT_BOMB_COUNT to get the amount of bombs on that vehicle.Old name:  _SET_VEHICLE_BOMBSOld name:  _SET_AIRCRAFT_BOMB_COUNTExamples:LuaC#local vehicle = GetVehiclePedIsIn(PlayerPedId(), false)\nSetAircraftBombCount(vehicle, 10)",
