Set to true to latch (lock) the roof, preventing it from being opened. Set to false to unlatch (unlock) the roof, allowing it to be opened or closed.This native is used to latch or unlatch the convertible roof of a vehicle. It allows for direct control over the roof's mechanism without actually opening or closing the roof. This can be useful for scenarios where you need to prepare a vehicle's roof to be opened or closed by another action or to ensure it remains fixed in its current state regardless of other interactions.NativeDB Introduced: v323Examples:LuaJavaScriptC#-- To latch (lock) the convertible roof, preventing it from being opened\nlocal vehicle = GetVehiclePedIsIn(PlayerPedId(), false)\nif not DoesVehicleHaveRoof(vehicle) then return end\nSetConvertibleRoofLatchState(vehicle, true)",
