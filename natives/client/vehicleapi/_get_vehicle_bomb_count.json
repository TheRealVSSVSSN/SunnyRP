As far as I know, this does not impact vehicle weapons or the ammo of those weapons in any way, it is just a way to keep track of the amount of bombs in a specific plane.In decompiled scripts this is used to check if the vehicle has enough bombs before a bomb can be dropped (bombs are dropped by using _SHOOT_SINGLE_BULLET_BETWEEN_COORDS_WITH_EXTRA_PARAMS).Use _SET_AIRCRAFT_BOMB_COUNT to set the amount of bombs on that vehicle.Old name:  _GET_AIRCRAFT_BOMB_COUNTExamples:LuaC#local vehicle = GetVehiclePedIsIn(PlayerPedId(), false)\nprint(\"This plane has \" .. GetAircraftBombCount(vehicle) .. \" bombs left.\")",
