Any value above 100.0 and less than 0.0 will have no effect on GET_PLAYER_UNDERWATER_TIME_REMAINING.Seems to lock the underwater timer of the specified player. Set percentage to 50.0 will reduce the value of GET_PLAYER_UNDERWATER_TIME_REMAINING to 5.0.If you want to increase the underwater time for ped, use SET_PED_MAX_TIME_UNDERWATER instead.Using this native after SET_PED_MAX_TIME_UNDERWATER WILL NOT get what you want. For example, if you set the max time underwater to 100.0 seconds using SET_PED_MAX_TIME_UNDERWATER and then call this native and set the percentage to 50.0, you will not get 50.0, instead 2.0.",
