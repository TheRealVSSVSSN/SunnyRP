Represents the height or elevation at the first point.x2: X coordinate of the second point.y2: Y coordinate of the second point.z2: Z coordinate of the second point. Represents the height or elevation at the second point.Returns: Returns the distance as a float between the two points (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z2) in the game world.Calculates the distance between two points in 3D space. For performance reasons, consider using direct mathematical calculations for distance, as they can be more efficient than calling this native function.NativeDB Introduced: v323Examples:LuajavascriptC#-- Define a set of coordinates\nlocal coords = vector3(145.0, 200.0, 1000.0)\n\n-- Get the player's current ped\nlocal playerPed = PlayerPedId()\n\n-- Get the player's current coordinates\nlocal coordsPlayer = GetEntityCoords(playerPed, false)\n\n-- Calculate the distance between the player and the coordinates\nlocal distance = Vdist(coordsPlayer.x, coordsPlayer.y, coordsPlayer.z, coords.x, coords.y, coords.z)\n\nif (distance < 10.0) then\n    print(\"You are close to the coordinates\")\nelse\n    print(\"You are far from the coordinates\")\nend",
