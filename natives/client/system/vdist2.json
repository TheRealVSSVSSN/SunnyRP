Represents the height or elevation at the first point.x2: X coordinate of the second point.y2: Y coordinate of the second point.z2: Z coordinate of the second point. Represents the height or elevation at the second point.Returns: Returns the distance as a float between the two points (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z2) in the game world.Calculates distance between vectors but does not perform Sqrt operations. Its way faster than VDIST, but it's not faster than direct mathematical calculations.NativeDB Introduced: v323",
