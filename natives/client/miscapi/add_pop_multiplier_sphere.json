For example, you can add a zone on 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 with radius 900.0 and vehicleMultiplier 0.0, and you will not see any new population vehicle spawned in a radius of 900.0 from 0.0, 0.0, 0.0. Returns the id. You can have only 15 zones at the same time. You can remove zone using REMOVE_POP_MULTIPLIER_SPHERE",
