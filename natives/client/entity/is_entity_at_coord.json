Transport modes are: 0 (any), 1 (on foot), 2 (in vehicle)Returns: A boolean value which represents if the entity is within the given square area.Checks if the entity is within the given square of size xSize, ySize, zSize centered around the given coordinates.The sizes given are the apothem (half of side) of the square, so a size of 5 would result in a square of 10x10, not 5x5.For the highlightArea, if do3dCheck is true, the marker will be drawn at the bottom of the target area. So if the square is centered on the ground with a zSize larger than 0, the marker will appear under the ground.\nThe marker also doesn't scale, so it is always the same size (around half a meter).\nSo unfortunately the marker isn't that useful as it doesn't convey the correct information about the area (the marker doesn't reflect when the player is actually in the marker or not)Examples:Lua-- Simple demonstration which slides the ped along the x and y axis until the ped is outside the given area\nlocal offset = 10\nwhile IsEntityAtCoord(PlayerPedId(), coords.x, coords.y, coords.z, 20.0, 20.0, 20.0, false, false, 0) do\n    offset += 0.1\n    local targetCoords = coords + vector3(offset, offset, 0)\n    SetEntityCoords(PlayerPedId(), targetCoords.x, targetCoords.y, targetCoords.z)\n    Citizen.Wait(0)\nend\nprint(i) -- Prints 20.1, as expected",
