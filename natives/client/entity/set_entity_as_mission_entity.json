This will only work on entities the machine has control of (non-remote entities).Assigns an existing entity to be owned by the current script. If the entity was not owned by a script yet, this also means the entity will remain persistent until released.Note that this is not needed right after creating an entity as a script-created entity will automatically be assigned.",
