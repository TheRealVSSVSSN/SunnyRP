Set to true to make the vehicle act as if it's at high speed for the current frameThis native is used to simulate a high-speed impact for a vehicle when it collides with a breakable object (frag). It's particularly useful in scripted sequences where a vehicle is required to break through a barrier but might not actually be moving at a sufficient speed to do so realistically. Note that this setting is temporary and will reset after one frame, so it needs to be called every frame for a lasting effect.",
