  "content": "0x71BDB63DBAF8DA590x5133A750// SetMinimapGolfCourse\nvoid SET_MINIMAP_GOLF_COURSE(int hole);Parameters:hole: The ID of the hole to draw on the map. ID starts with 1 for hole 1, 2 for hole 2, etc. 0 disables the golf map behaviour.Not much is known so far on what it does exactly.\nAll I know for sure is that it draws the specified hole ID on the pause menu map as well as on the mini-map/radar. This native also seems to change some other things related to the pause menu map's behaviour, for example: you can no longer set waypoints, the pause menu map starts up in a 'zoomed in' state. This native does not need to be executed every tick.You need to center the minimap manually as well as change/lock it's zoom and angle in order for it to appear correctly on the minimap.\nYou'll also need to use the GOLF scaleform in order to get the correct minmap border to show up.Use SET_MINIMAP_GOLF_COURSE_OFF() to reset the map when you no longer want to display any golf holes (you still need to unlock zoom, position and angle of the radar manually after calling this).Examples:C#// draw hole 2\nSetMinimapGolfCourse(2);\n\n// set the other minimap properties for this specific hole:\nSetRadarZoom(850);\nLockMinimapPosition(-1220.0f, 240.0f);\nLockMinimapAngle(90);\nToggleStealthRadar(false);\nSetRadarBigmapEnabled(false, false);\n\n// Create the flag blip and set the sprite to the flag sprite.\nint blip = AddBlipForCoord(-1321.98f, 158.93f, 57.8f);\nSetBlipSprite(blip, 358);\n\n// result of this code example: https://i.imgur.com/DUnUzKS.png",
