This function supports SDK infrastructure and is not intended to be used directly from your code.This should be used from JavaScript or another language supporting mutable buffers like ArrayBuffer.Matrix layout is as follows:Element [0], [1] and [2] should represent the right vector.Element [4], [5] and [6] should represent the forward vector.Element [8], [9] and [10] should represent the up vector.Element [12], [13] and [14] should represent X, Y and Z translation coordinates.All other elements should be [0, 0, 0, 1].",
