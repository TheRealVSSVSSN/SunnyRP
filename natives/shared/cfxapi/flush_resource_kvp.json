They will be much faster than their synchronous counterparts (e.g., bulk operations), however, a system crash may lose the data to some recent operations.This native ensures all _NO_SYNC operations are synchronized with the disk/filesystem.Examples:Lua-- Bulk write many <key, value> pairs to the resource KVP.\nlocal key = \"bug_%d\"\nlocal value = \"unintended_feature_%d\"\nfor i=1,10000 do\n\tSetResourceKvpNoSync(key:format(i), value:format(i))\nend\n\n-- Ensure all data is synchronized to the filesystem\nFlushResourceKvp()",
