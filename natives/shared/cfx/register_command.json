Or by entering them in the server console/through an RCON client (only works for server side registered commands). Or if you use a supported chat resource, like the default one provided in the cfx-server-data repository, then you can enter the command in chat by prefixing it with a /.Commands registered using this function can also be executed by resources, using the ExecuteCommand native.The restricted bool is not used on the client side.
