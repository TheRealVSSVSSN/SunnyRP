A resource for FiveM to make resource creation easier and allows for easy communication between them.

**Note this is the latest version from EssentialMode before it got removed from the forum.   
We pushed it back to github so people can still use es_freeroam since it requires EssentialMode.   
Warning: We do not provide support regarding installation/bug reports for EssentialMode.**
