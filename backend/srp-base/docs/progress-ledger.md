# Progress Ledger – SRP‑Base Node Backend

This ledger tracks our progress porting server behaviours from the
legacy resources repository into the unified `srp‑base` Node.js
backend.  For each resource processed, we record its index (based on
alphabetical ordering in the legacy `resources` directory), a brief
summary of its server responsibilities, our decision (Skip/Extend/Create),
and a reference to the patch or commit in this repository.  Only
server‑side logic is considered; purely client resources are skipped.

Extend — documented evidence API in OpenAPI and module docs. | this sprint |
| 4 | np‑evidence | Receives `evidence:pooled`, `evidence:removal` and `evidence:clear` events; relays them to clients via corresponding events【457964279538678†L0-L15】. | Create — added evidence routes/events; OpenAPI and docs extended. | See previous sprint |
