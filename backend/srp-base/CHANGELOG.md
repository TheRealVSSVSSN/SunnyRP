# Changelog

## 2025‑08‑18

### Added

* **Broadcaster module.** Implemented a new Express route (`/v1/broadcast/attempt`) that allows a
  player to become a broadcaster job if fewer than `MAX_BROADCASTERS` players
  currently hold the role.  The route uses `jobsRepository.countPlayersForJob`
  to enforce the limit and `jobsRepository.assignJob` to assign the job.
  Added configuration via `MAX_BROADCASTERS` environment variable.
* **jobsRepository helpers.** Added `countPlayersForJob` and `getJobByName`
  functions to `jobsRepository.js` to support generic lookup and counting
  operations by job name.

### Changed

* **app.js**: Mounted the new broadcaster route.

### Notes

This sprint continues the integration of NoPixel server behaviours into
the unified `srp‑base` Node.js backend.  The broadcaster module
implements the server-side logic of the NoPixel `np-broadcaster`
resource in a RESTful manner.  The limit of concurrent broadcasters
is configurable via the `MAX_BROADCASTERS` environment variable.

## 2025‑08‑19

### Added

* **Framework compliance documentation.** Added `DOCS/framework-compliance.md` which
  defines a rubric for what constitutes a robust Node.js service (layering,
  configuration, DI, testing, etc.) and evaluates `srp‑base` against it.

### Changed

* **progress-ledger.md** – added entries for `np‑errorlog`, `LockDoors` and
  `np‑density`, all of which were skipped due to existing error logging
  functionality or lack of server logic.
* **index.md** – added sprint overview for 2025‑08‑19 summarising
  documentation efforts and skip decisions.

### Notes

This sprint focused on research and documentation rather than new
features.  After auditing Node.js architecture best practices,
we concluded that the current codebase already satisfies many of
the core requirements.  The NoPixel resources processed during this
cycle contained no server logic that warranted implementation, so
the service code remains unchanged.  Future sprints will continue
processing additional resources and address remaining gaps in testing,
dependency injection and continuous integration.
